# FreeCodeCamp-Python-Projects - These projects are required to earn the Scientific Computing with Python(Beta) certification from FreeCodeCamp. I see that there is an over-reliance on if-else statements, presumably due to not uncovering better approaches towards algorithm building. I am planning to update the code for the projects as I deepen my understanding of Python. Feel free to review my code and offer suggestions, Thanks!
